[More Money For Better Open-Source Software](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/sustainable-maintenance.html)

> I am going to emphasize, in the docs, the license file, and the communication surrounding the project, that free-loading is not socially acceptable. Along with this, I will provide convenient mechanisms to donate. The code of financial conduct would be something like this:
> 
> - If you are a non-commercial user, don't worry about it.
> - If I fix a bug you reported or add a feature you wanted and you have the financial means, a one-time tip is much appreciated. Even if this is unlikely to add up to serious money, it takes the one-sidedness out of the process of responding to user requests.
> - If you are extracting value from your use of my software, set up a proportional monthly donation.
>
> The monthly part is the important thing here. Having to periodically beg a user base to please contribute to a donation drive again is a drag, and not very effective. Convincing users to donate as long as they get value from the software gives a maintainer a more or less predictable, low-maintenance source of compensations for their work.

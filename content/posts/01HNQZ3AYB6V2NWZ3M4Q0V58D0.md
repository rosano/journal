[The Cheap Web](https://potato.cheap)

> The "cheap" web is a solarpunk philosophy of web design.

> cheap ≠ free 
> cheap ≠ sleek
> cheap ≠ creep
> cheap ≠ deep
> cheap ≠ dark
> cheap = cheap

> Cheap to maintain: Most webpages should work indefinitely without falling over.

> Cheap to access: Most websites should be compatible with screenreaders, etc.

> Cheap to explore: Exploring the web should be pleasant on 1W of power.

> Cheap to contribute: Making/hosting websites should be easier than scrapbooking.

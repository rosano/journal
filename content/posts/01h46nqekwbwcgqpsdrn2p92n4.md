[#246 â€“ Doing Content Right with Steph Smith of Trends.co](https://pca.st/fvi5g2ti)

> [Podcasts like are best friends, newsletters like acquaintances, blogs like random people you meet at conferences. You may never even know pay attention to who's writing an article.]

> [Smaller numbers but quality relationships with everyone learning and growing together]

> [Podcasts are top of funnel and a big ask for people to listen for an hour. Strategically talk about the topic in other channels, and plug the podcast when it bites.]

> [You wouldn't hang out with a friend for an hour a week if they had no sense of humour and were purely informational, the experience needs to be fun.]

> Only by tasting can you learn to connect the decisions you make with their outcomes.

> [Taste, listen, smell, touch, and watch as much as possible.]

> I cook mostly with my hands: they're calibrated, by now, to turn things at the right moments, to choose correct amounts of salt. They seem to know before I do when to stop squeezing a lemon, or how much parsley to grab.

> Ingredients don't take three or five or ten minutes to be done; it depends on the day and the stove.

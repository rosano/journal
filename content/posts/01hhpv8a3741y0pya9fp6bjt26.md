[No more raw data | Ruben Verborgh](https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2023/11/10/no-more-raw-data/)

> [Sometimes it's better not to decide what data you share, and defer the choice to someone with more expertise, such as medical data being provisioned by your doctor (who likely knows better how to respond to the request).]

> Not only can my pod automatically fill out such forms; the forms donâ€™t need to be there in the first place, because my pod can just share the needed data, machine to machine.

> [Recipients will want to keep the trust envelope because it's their proof to an auditor that they comply with its policy.]

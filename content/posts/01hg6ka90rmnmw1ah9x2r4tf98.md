[LocalCan™ - HTTPS domains for localhost and wi-fi network](https://www.localcan.com)

> Develop your apps locally with .local domains and HTTPS using LocalCan™ app for macOS

Nicer than my current setup of editing `/etc/hosts`, adding `127.0.0.1	loc.whatever`, entering my password… But I hesitate to have an experience too difference from another person who would run my apps.

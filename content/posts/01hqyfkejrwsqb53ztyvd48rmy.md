[Support Kottke.org With a Membership](https://kottke.org/members)

> About 45% of those who have been a member of kottke.org are currently not active paying members. That's a lot of churn! If even half of those folks would re-up, I could do some additional cool shit around here, I think. That said, the number of active members has remained relatively steady over time, which I'm thankful for.

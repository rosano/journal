[Men & Grief](https://www.tiktok.com/@watchfulcoyote/video/7438713899886644511)

> [All grief is one: like touching the ocean at any of the imaginary lines we've drawn, it's all one body of water.]

> [When my partner senses that I'm holding back grief and invites me with a simple gesture like a hand on the shoulder, it's hard to meet them there but I try to anyway, because to say "no worries, everything's fine" would be to negate their good instincts for how I'm feeling.]

> [I appreciate things that make me cry because they give me the chance to shed a few more of the tears repressed during
childhood, when I had learned that doing so was dangerous.]

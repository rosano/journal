[Money - Simple English Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money)

> [Through bartering, more value accrued to objects that were easier to carry around.]

> [The first country to create a coin was Lydia, spreading to Greece and the Mediterranean, and eventually the rest of the world.]

> [Money was favourable because it was interchangeable (fungible), could be easily divided or carried around, and lasted longer.]

> Add one and a half times as much white
vinegar as water to a pot and bring it to a boil. For every four cups of liquid, add a quarter cup salt and a quarter cup raw sugar, and simmer until they dissolve. Or don't measure anything and add salt and sugar until the brine tastes like you want the vegetable you've preserved in it to: potent, salty, and just barely sweet.

> Pickle brine is also the best place, other than cocktails, to put leftover brine from jars of capers and other pickles. If you have any, either add them to your own brine, or simply heat them all together, taste them, then add salt or sugar or water or straight vinegar until it tastes good.

> [Serve your guests something that is best cooked in advance so you can spend more time with them instead of scrambling in another room.]

> [Let guests pick herbs or slice bread instead of bringing salad, so that you can offer a meal as well as receive help and turn the kitchen into a collaborative space.]

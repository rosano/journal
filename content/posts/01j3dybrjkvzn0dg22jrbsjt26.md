[Capital by Karl Marx on Blinkist.](https://www.blinkist.com/books/capital-en)

> [Human labour transforms raw resources into commodities that have a 'use value' and 'exchange value'.]

> [Work is a means to survive, rather than express creativity or humanity, and alienates workers from each other by forcing them to compete against one another for limited jobs.]

> [Value comes from human labour, and transitioning entirely to mechanized labour generally reduces the rate of profit.]

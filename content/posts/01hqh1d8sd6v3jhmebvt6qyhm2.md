[What is the Difference Between a Radler and a Shandy? | Druthers Brewing Company](https://www.druthersbrewing.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-radler-and-a-shandy/)

> Shandy originated in the 1850s in England where it was earlier known as Shandygaff. The Shandygaff was a mixture of beer and ginger ale or ginger beer. By the late 19th-century, the ginger ale in the Shandygaff was replaced by lemonade or lemon soda, and the “gaff” was dropped to shorten the word to just Shandy.

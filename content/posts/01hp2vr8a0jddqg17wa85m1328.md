[Djavan: *a voz e o violão* (1976)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mEFSrKiN464689gygq7hL9Y6LM86aO59E)

Perfect fusing of the Brazilian language's natural rhythm with samba's flow: 4. *Para-raio* reminds me of the 'perfect fit' between words and percussion I hear in João Donato's music; 9. *Embola Bola (Cateretê)* barely has words, almost pure voice percussion; 11. *Magia* feels like hip-hop; 12. *Ventos do Norte* like swing jazz.

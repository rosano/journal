In the same way that Instagram forces posting regularly in order to exist, perhaps all reverse-chronological timelines force ephemeral content. You can reference or quote to old tweets if you're lucky, but still feels like 'posting once makes it disappear' unless you repeat the same isolated fragment frequently. How can one get a sense for how another thinks if they only read one tweet at a time and those tweets are spread out over a year? Perhaps 'update platforms' are not designed to understand larger thoughts? Blog posts can also be reverse-chronological but each can include dense context and past references so that you can collapse time in order to understand larger thoughts. So perhaps 'update platforms' are best suited to your 'current status' and those might as well disappear after 24 hours like 'ephemeral stories'; if you want to get around ephemeral content, use a blog.

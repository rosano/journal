Tried to understand why my Kobo doesn't mount to the computer when connecting via cable.

[Kobo not connecting to computer...](https://www.reddit.com/r/kobo/comments/mkb6lh/kobo_not_connecting_to_computer/)

> [Use the cable that came with the Kobo.]  

> [Try a different cable.]  

> [Try a different computer.]  

> [USB 3 ports may cause issues. Try a cheap USB 2 hub in between.]  

> [Some USB cables are charge-only!]

[Kobo Aura H2O keeps Connecting and Disconnecting USB issue [Solved-ish]](https://www.reddit.com/r/kobo/comments/om1xci/kobo_aura_h2o_keeps_connecting_and_disconnecting/)

> [Try turning off Wi-Fi.] Seems that the WiFi and the USB subsystems might be sharing a data path to the processor, so there can be conflicts between them.

[Kobo not recognized by computer](https://www.reddit.com/r/kobo/comments/8cfygq/kobo_not_recognized_by_computer/)

> Transferring over wifi: Calibre has a content server (you can find it under preferences, sharing, sharing over the net), your Kobo can connect to it with its browser (under extra's). The default port is 8080, there's a more detailed explanation on the content server dialog.  

More Wi-Fi possibilities in [Add Books Over WiFi?](https://www.reddit.com/r/kobo/comments/ks5rr2/add_books_over_wifi/), but the filenames tend to get mangled when importing this way, so I don't like it.

[Official documentation](https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005659942-Troubleshoot-issues-connecting-your-eReader-to-your-computer-with-a-USB-cable) discusses none of these issues

Would love to recommend a 'Canadian alternative' to Amazon, but no longer wish anyone to experience 'fussy' electronics.

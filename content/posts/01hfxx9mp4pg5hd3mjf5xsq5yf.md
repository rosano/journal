[A lot of us eat oranges and throw out the peels.. but donâ€™t! Take advantage of their benefits and make your own cleaning spray!](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cz92ie_vlqK/)

> [Pack a jar with orange peels, fill with vinegar, and let sit in a cool dark place. After two weeks, strain into a spray bottle. The D-limonene combined with vinegar is a naturally powerful household cleaner.]

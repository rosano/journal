I've been to the Hackerspace Wiki before to find local places while travelling. I didn't know they had [hackerspace apps listing](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Hackerspace_Software), [software wishlists](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Software_Wish_List).

Their [design patterns library](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Design_Patterns) includes [The Community Pattern](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/The_Community_Pattern):

> set up a mailing list, a wiki, and an IRC channel. You will need all three. Think about a platform for discussion, storage for documentation and real-time communication.

[The Critical Mass Pattern](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/The_Critical_Mass_Pattern):

> [You need at least two people to start an idea and two more to get work done. It's easy to recruit once you have four people, and best to get started with ten.]

[The Infrastructure Pattern](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/The_Infrastructure_Pattern):

> [Infrastructure first or projects first? By making everything infrastructure-driven, people will come up with contributions you would have never thought about.]

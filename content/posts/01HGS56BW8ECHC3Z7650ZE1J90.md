[Handstand progression with a wall](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C0MZ_6QLQqI/)

> [First stage; keep your knees bent and touch your toes. Second stage: stretch one leg up straight. Third stage: loosen your toe touching the wall a bit. Fourth stage: loosen it even more until you almost don't need to depend on it. Fifth stage: lift your toe away from the wall. Sixth stage: stretch the other leg. Give some weeks per stage and get comfortable holding for twenty seconds before advancing to the next.]

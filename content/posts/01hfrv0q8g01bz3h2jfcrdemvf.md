[So many of us throw these things out..](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cz17U52SuAo/)

> [Instead of wasting the ends of these veggies, grow something from them.]

> [Lettuce and celery bottoms can be cut around two inches and half submerged with sticks in a cup of water (ideally filtered).]

> [Take one stick of basil, remove the bottom leaves, cut the bottom of the stem at a forty-five degree angle, and place the top part in a shot glass for three days. When it grows roots, plant it in soil.]

> [Green onions or scallions can be planted directly in soil to regrow in about six days.]

> [Carrot tops can be cut to about an inch and planted directly in soil.]

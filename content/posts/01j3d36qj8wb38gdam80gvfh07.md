> [Habits compound when repeated but results are not noticeable day-to-day.]

> [Focus on your trajectory instead of the result.]

> [Habits are by being led from cues that triggers you to act, to cravings for a specific outcome, to responses that alleviate yhe craving, to an eventual reward that gives you a positive feeling.]

> [Help strengthen your cue by changing your environment and implementing an intention or plan.]

> [Bundle habits you avoid with ones you like.]

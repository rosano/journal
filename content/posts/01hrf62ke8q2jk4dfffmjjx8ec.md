> Imprisoned in every UI is a concatenative REPL operating on a stack. Buttons do "type function + Enter," GUI renders return stack.

Are there examples of the opposite of this where "imprisoned in every command-line program is a GUI that lets you discover its features" or "type command with arguments becomes a button"?

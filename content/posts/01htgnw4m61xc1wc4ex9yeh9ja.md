[Let's talk about books to read....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHMcLRjChvw)

> [Types of books you might want to read: 1. a religious text (other than your own if you have one); 2. the perspective of any subculture; 3. making the monster human; 4. a political ideology; 5. your childhood hero or strongest memory memory; 6. the hero of your enemy; 7. favourable about someone you don't like; 8. critical of war; 9. critical of your heroes; 10. about ancient or indigenous peoples (if they were oral, imagine what might have gotten lost by writing); 11. a distopia; 12. about a character you can't relate to at all.]

> Literature exposes you to things you wouldn't experience in real life.

[Tiktokâ€™s enshittification](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/)

> This is enshittification: surpluses are first directed to users; then, once they're locked in, surpluses go to suppliers; then once they're locked in, the surplus is handed to shareholders and the platform becomes a useless pile of shit. From mobile app stores to Steam, from Facebook to Twitter, this is the enshittification lifecycle.

> [The word 'monetize' implies there is no 'attention economy' in the pure sense: users need to pay fiat at some point.]

[Problems and Goals for Interoperability, Collaboration, and Security in a Solid Pod](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/blob/main/problems-and-goals.md)

> Applications must have a shared understanding of data

> Data must be discoverable.

> Data must be durable.

> Data must be portable. 

> Problem #3 - Disparate entities using different applications must be able to safely and effectively interoperate within their scope of authorization

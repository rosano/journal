[Paulâ€™s notes on how JSON-LD works](https://paulfrazee.medium.com/pauls-notes-on-how-json-ld-works-965732ea559d)

> [`@vocab` maps a default prefix to keys not mapped explicitly in `@context`].

> [`@context` provides only definitions to map your keys, it's not a type. `@type` is a type, and can be defined with a URL or a term from `@context`.

> [`@id`'s value is a reference to another object or node.]

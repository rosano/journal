# Ingredients

- 5 small onions, sliced
- 1 head garlic, bottom sliced off
- ½ cup sun dried tomatoes, chopped
- 1 tbsp paprika
- 1 tsp dried parsley
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- ½ cup coconut milk
- 3 cups farfalle pasta, cooked
- 1 handful fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 handful fresh basil, chopped

# Method

- Preheat the oven to 400°F. Put the onions, tomatoes, and spices in a casserole dish, then toss together. Place the garlic head in the center and drizzle with oil. Cover with foil and bake for an hour or until the onions are caramelized, tossing halfway through.
- Before the the onions are done, prepare the pasta and reserve a cup of the water.
- Remove the garlic from the casserole dish, squeeze out the cloves when safe, and mix together with the fresh herbs, lemon juice, coconut milk, pasta, and pasta water as needed.

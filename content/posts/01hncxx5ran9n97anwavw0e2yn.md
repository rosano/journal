[I turned off analytics](https://rachsmith.com/i-turned-off-analytics/)

> I don’t care about what gets ranked on Google, I’m not trying to optimise for the people who come from that channel.

> People who arrive via search are just looking to get a question answered and move on. That’s great and I hope I can help them, but they are not the reason I’m here. This site is here for the people who stay a while, have a look around and then send me an email to start an interesting conversation.

I've been feeling similar lately, but erring on the side of continuing until there's a specific reason to stop; there's some underlying fear of losing something in the future that I can't describe. The data is kind of boring—maybe the whole notion of this analytics exploits a 'wanting to know where people come from' and the deep-seated desire for connection. I'm curious in your case, why not 'just' make a filter to see the non-search data?

I definitely believe in meaningful connections as the fundamental focus for myself; measuring this might be valuable but not necessary for me, I'd prefer to hear people's stories of change over seeing numbers. Wishing that your 'search query' returns results 🙏🏽☀️.

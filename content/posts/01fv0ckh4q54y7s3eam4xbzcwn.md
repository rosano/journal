[The roads to funding your community network projects....](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw0gt6Ao_yk)

> [Make goals that are quantifiable, and achievable: big enough to matter and small enough to win. You want to overshoot your goal every single time. Set it up so that you win every single time.]

> [In pre-advertising: announce what you're going to do and how people can get involved.]

> [Naming your benefactors might create a burden of association when you are perceived as divisive. Maybe don't tell them or mention them until its done.]

> [Remind people of the cause but don't focus on the negative aspect so that people walk away feeling positive. If they feel bad, they won't return.]

> [Don't guess what they need: ask them.]

> [Delivering on the goal means not failing: if you're short, cover out of pocket.]

> [Document the delivery so that the people involved can see it after and feel good about making it happen.]

Making people feel they're participation made the difference isn't just for humility, it's to help them feel their impact.

[A Failure Resume](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/a-failure-resume)

> This document has served as a powerful reminder to myself of how much I’ve struggled to get to where I am and why I deserve to be here. And more importantly, it serves as a place to reflect and learn from the past and be less scared of failure in the future.

We might be unnecessarily framing our limitations within a common narrative around why developers struggle to find collaborators. Doing this distracts from our unfair advantage of creating connection, which has been and can be a basis for many meaningful possibilities in our life. In the same way we can try to go beyond money to focus on the underlying need, we can go beyond traditional pathways to finding collaboration to focus on connecting with people and changing their lives, trusting that this will feed into our process positively.

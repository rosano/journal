[Daryl Davis on Reforming Over 200 ‘Ku Klux Klan’ Members - by Befriending Them](https://youtu.be/FdI_ayaAXDE)

> [Five core universal values underlie human interaction: to be loved, respected, heard, treated fair, and to want the same for one's family.]

> [Treating Neo-nazism as a culture without justifying it enables you to approach the people as with any other culture.]

> [Avoid focusing on destruction, hate, or fear as they are symptoms. The root cause of ignorance, cured through education and exposure, will get symptoms under control.]

> [How to be offended by insults from someone who doesn't know you? They have no credibility.]

> [Allow people time and space to marinate with ideas, avoid impatience. Even if they don't like you, they might give you a return visit, and that's what you want. Don't destroy your credibility by lying.]

> [Find and build upon the commonalities.]

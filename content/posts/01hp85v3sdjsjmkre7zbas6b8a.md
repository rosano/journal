[Hugo Testing](https://github.com/jmooring/hugo-testing)

Each branch of Joe's `hugo-testing` git repository is a scratchpad where he has over 750 attempted 'solutions' to help different people on the [Hugo forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io). Seems like discovery requires starting at a specific topic (as opposed to searching for the problem or solution), but it's quite organized the way it is. How might being this prolific in helping others impact one's own skills?

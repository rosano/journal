[How Jacob Collier Reinvented The Guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WknTbYOet4c)

> [Being uncertain and curious is a more interesting place for me than knowing what I'm doing.]

> [More important than recognizing the name or function of the notes played, I have an awareness of their emotional properties and how they will pull the listener into specific spaces.]

> [It's popular and valid to recreate and enjoy something you heard before; try to be clear when you want that versus something new.]

> [Rather than have a disciplined practice regime, I find myself in specific and tsrgeted moments of deep exploration.]

> [One of the best gifts you can give to an audience is to fumble, because it's an invitation for them to join you at the edge of your own exploration where mist of the interesting stuff is. Music isn't really that serious.]

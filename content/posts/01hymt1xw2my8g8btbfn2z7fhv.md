I was wondering if it's possible to load a local JavaScript file via bookmarklet (to get around Firefox's character limit) but it seems `file://` URLs will return an error. I can either load an `https://` URL or embed my file [inside an extension](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10611796/is-there-any-way-to-load-a-local-js-file-dynamically).

[My Secret Teaching Framework (Revealed)](https://ollyrichards.co/blog/teaching-framework/)

> [Organize your message by: 1) starting with the *point* up-front; 2) tell a *story* to demonstrate; 3) make it more relatable with a *metaphor*; and 4) re-state the point.]

In a way similar to "tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them" with a focus on starting with useful information. I've been organizing myself lately to share 'nuggets', which give you something without having to read further, and like the idea of progressively adding layers or enriching what was previously stated.

> [The idle mind is not of the devil but of God. By being empty we are able to receive.]

> [You don't sleep by doing anything: when activity stops, you simply go into sleep.]

> [Relaxation means the moment is enough: feeling yourself, and being present is so satisfying it's too much.]

> [Activity is goal-oriented and constantly turns the present into a means for the future, thus ensuring relaxation remains on the horizon and never comes.]

> [The celebrator doesn't need to create anything because everything already exists and they are grateful for the abundance.]

> [Don't desire anything, including spiritual things, God, or liberation. When you are desire-less, the seed explodes.]

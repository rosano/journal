> [When we're starved for deeply meaningful experiences, it becomes easy to counterfeit consciousness and sell us a shell of it.]

> [Most of what exists is likely unknowable.]

> [Religion and science collapse the super-container into incomplete representations.]

> [The world is fundamentally one being first, unless we separate it into distinctions. Therefore if we destroy it we're destroying ourselves.]

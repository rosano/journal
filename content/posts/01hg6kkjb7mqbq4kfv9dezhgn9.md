'Toragesic' is a brand of Brazilian back pain medication recommended by my therapist. I took sublingual tablets; was pretty fast and effective; tried to use it while also resting (not stressing or working during recovery) and I usually was normal after a few days. Some information in Portuguese from [tuasaude.com](https://www.tuasaude.com/toragesic-trometamol-cetorolaco/) and less in English from [rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/toragesic) and [drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/international/toragesic.html)

Category is 'anti-inflamatorio analg√©sico' (translation I guess is '[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug)')

Active ingredient is 'trometamol cetorolaco' (translation [Ketorolac tromethamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketorolac))

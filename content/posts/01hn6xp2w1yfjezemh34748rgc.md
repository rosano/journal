What a 'new tab page' this is! I prefer queries (via keystroke launchers like Quicksilver or 'Command-K') over big lists, but this is beautifully personal and makes me drool; stable options can leverage muscle memory and reduce distractions. 👍🏽

Provokes me to wonder about social patterns and 'formats' like /now or 'daily note', ways of organizing that many people can practice and share so that we can all learn from each other.

[SCAMPER is a procedural idea generator](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/scamper)

> S: Can I **substitute** a material? A key ingredient? A process? What happens if I substitute an emotion? Can I substitute the packaging for something else?

> C: Can I **combine** different components to create something new? Can I bundle things in a new way? Can I combine different use-cases, such as author and reader, or seller and buyer?

> A: Can I **adapt** a process from somewhere else? A component from something else? Can I adapt it to existing infrastructure? Can I adjust something just 3% to create something new?

> M: Can I **modify** the form factor? Shape? Color? Can I **magnify** the key idea? What happens if I magnify an attribute beyond all reason? Or **minify** it?

> P: Can I **put a component to other uses**? A mechanism? A process? An idea? A set of rules? Can I transform a waste product into an input? Can I put it to use in another context? Can I translate it into another medium? Create spinoffs?

> E: Can I **eliminate** a rule? Can I simplify it? Make it compact? Eliminate a feature? Remove a complication?

> R: Can I **reverse** a relationship? An assumption? What happens if I reverse my point of view? Can I rearrange the sequence? The layout? The structure? Can I rearrange the components to create something new?

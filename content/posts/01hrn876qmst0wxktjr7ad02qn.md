> One of the coolest things I've been told about jazz is that the better you are as a player, the better experts sound. I've been called a talented musician but I am absolutely, unabashedly ecstatic to hear music that I can barely understand what's happening. The piano and that sax solo mostly sound like random chaos and it excites me to know there's structure and intent and beauty in there, waiting to be understood by the skill I have yet to achieve.

[We interviewed the Mozart of Gen Z - Colin and Samir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7rvDA3MARk)

> [Your heroes make things possible.]

> [Finding your voice involves trying stuff; not possible to 'contribute' by waiting to find your voice first.]

> [Try making the worst song ever.]

> [A question culture versus answee culture.]

> [Questions last longer than answers.]

> [My room is my spaceship and I can command it to go wherever I want. My job is to tune in to the internal weather: what's turning me on today?]

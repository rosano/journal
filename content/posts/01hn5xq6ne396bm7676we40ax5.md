[what happens in the conversations I have with the ppl I'm coaching](https://twitter.com/richdecibels/status/1626498459376226304)

> [I offer: space away from the rat-race to reflect, breathe more deeply, move deliberately; a good bullshit detector; place to practice, prepare, or role-play tough future conversations; help to find the right amount of stretch in your development goal without overdoing to short circuit progress; encouragement if you need someone telling you to quit your job.]

> [Improve your interpersonal dynamics by seeing the relationship as something that can be co-designed in process rather than 'agreed upon'.]

> [My formal training is in engineering and agriculture. I coach because people ask me, not because I'm certified.]

> [Smaller organizations might not be able to afford leadership coaching from professionals but can afford peer-to-pear from like-minded companions.]

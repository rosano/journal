[Everyone Can Build a Twitter Audience](https://app.gumroad.com/d/4babf55e20fcea3369b5b81773df11a5)

> [Describe interesting things you've done in your life to build credibility: share what you learned or what someone like you would want to know.]

> [You can document things that have already happened. Some of it might resonate with others.]

> [An indicator of credibility is that people will want to ask you questions to learn more about your experience.]

> [It wasn't the book, but documenting how I published it that gave me credibility in self-publishing.]

> [Success is not followers but people wanting to hear what you have to say.]

> [They either need to be getting something from you or getting to know you as a person.]

> [Giving means they stop on your tweet and don't regret it. Asking means anything that benefits you directly, like clicking links.]

> [Use your pinned tweet to gain credibility.]

> [Inspiration can be something interesting that happened today, things that took a lot of effort to figure out, answers you gave in your conversations that could be relevant to your audience.]

> [Find the intersection of interesting to you, interesting to your audience, and having credibility to say it.]

> [Don't tag people hoping they'll notice you.]

> [Build your credibility, promote it everywhere, and look for opportunities to build more credibility.]

> [Give and ask with a seven to one ratio.]

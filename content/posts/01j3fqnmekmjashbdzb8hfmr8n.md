[The E-Myth Revisited by Michael E. Gerber on Blinkist.](https://www.blinkist.com/books/the-e-myth-revisited-en)

> [Technical skill alone is insufficient to kickstart a successful business and can easily lead to unsustainable models where the founder does everything.]

> [Turnkey businesses are popular because they have a far higher success rate; they consider and plan all aspects of the business beforehand so that the owner doesn't need to be present.]

> [Every single process needs to be documented in order for someone to run the business without you.]

> [Structure all aspects of the business to support your personal objectives.]

> [Your marketing should consider the customer and ignore everything else. Get to know their profile as best as you can and market in ways that are appealing to them. Adapt your strategy as they change.]

> [All of this 'business development process' never stops, continuing as you learn while in motion and understand through testing.]

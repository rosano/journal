[Neologisms](https://maggieappleton.com/neologisms)

> __Hospice Mode__: The stage your when your phone / fitness tracker / laptop is in its final months and you're just prolonging its death through a series of coping techniques. Carrying around extra battery packs. Patiently giving it 10 minutes to restart. Resetting the system at regular intervals.

> __Manel__: Panel made up entirely of men. Usually honouring work done entirely by other men.

> __Pinkering__: Named for Steven Pinker - a common phenomenon among do-gooder elites who cite the long arc of human history in order to downplay and minimise any immediate suffering.

> __Privacy Veganism__: Unnecessarily shaming people who aren't willing to delete their Facebook account when itâ€™s a functional necessity in their social context

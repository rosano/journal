> When someone you love dies, you don't just lose them in the present or in the past. You lose the future you should have had, and might have had, with them. They are missing from all the life that was to be. Seeing other people get married, have kids, travel-all the things you expected out of life with your person-gone. Seeing other children go to kindergarten, or graduate, or get married—all those things your child should have done, had they lived. Your kids never get to know their brilliant uncle; your friend never gets to read your finished book.

> A day (or more) inside a blanket fort of your own choosing is healthy.

> [Being kind to yourself means not letting your own mind beat you up.]

> [Early grief is liminal: we are no longer who we were and not yet solidified into something new—everything is in flux.]

> [Anxiety can be overwhelming as there's no shortage of potential disasters. You can trust yourself.]

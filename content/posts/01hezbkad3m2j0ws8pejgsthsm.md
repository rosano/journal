[What Great Listeners Actually Do - A Visual Guide](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzVvFt2rqrW/)

> [A good listener bounces ideas like a trampoline rather than absorbing like a sponge.]

> [Good listeners: 1) ask questions that promote discovery and insight; 2) cultivate spaces to promote self-esteem; 3) challenge or disagree cooperatively, without making others defensive; 4) suggest open alternative paths in the conversation.]

> [Levels of listening: 1) create a discussion environment safely; 2) remove distractions; 3) understand the substance and clarify or confirm with questions; 4) observe nonverbal cues, which may make up 80% of the conversation; 5) empathize with emotions about the topic; 6) gently encourage and help them to see the issue in another light.]

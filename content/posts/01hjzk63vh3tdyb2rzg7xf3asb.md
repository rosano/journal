> What is your relationship to the unknown? What is it like to have sensitivity to nature and spirits?

> [Reason habituates us to asking black-and-white questions like "what is real?" and "what actually happened?" when actually there's no need to go there, to the point that some people feel a sense of duty to correct others who believe in something considered unacceptable.]

> [Ghosts are more heart-realm metaphors than head-realm beings.]

> To ask a good question, walk right up to the perimeter of your current understanding about something and find a question that you don't know the answer to.

> [Instead of "are ghosts real?" ask "what experiences led you to your beliefs?".]

> It's amazing to have a chance to peek into someone's belief systems and memories, a treasure trove wasted by a bad question.

> [People don't need to answer, or do so truthfully.]

> [Open and honest dialogue requires the information shared to not be weaponized.]

> [The fruits of disagreement include: 1. security (negotiating for foundation); 2. growth (taking risks to discover new possibilities and potential security); 3. connection (being able to relate to people with diverse perspectives); and 4. enjoyment, learning to enjoy fundamental disagreements because the discussion brings new nuance each time.]

> [Going beyond battling for security diffuses the zero-sum game to enable everyone to gain and grow from the experience.]

> [Most people buy transactionally to make money or get laid, and non-transactionally to support things they like. Framing yourself as a utility lands you in the first category. People want a parasocial relationship with creators, and will pay to feel excused from not trying the creative path themselves. Doing and publishing isn't enough to land you in the second category: documenting and explaining in an artful way can become as important as what you're making. Maintaining a community implies being more active on social media.]

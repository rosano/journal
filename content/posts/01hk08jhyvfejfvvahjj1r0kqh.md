[Let's talk about balance and advice for the unvaccinated....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcnCYdZw72k)

> Make a plan for your kids, discuss it with them. Write your will. Sign a power of attorney. Talk about DNR/DNI with your family and decide if it's right for you. Make one box for originals or copies of the following: life insurance policy; home and car owners insurance; medical and vaccination records; tax records; court orders, such as child support and custody; social security card; marriage license; birth certificate; passports; vehicle titles and registrations; important documents and anything you don't want to lose; copies of last months bills (make it easy for the person taking care)

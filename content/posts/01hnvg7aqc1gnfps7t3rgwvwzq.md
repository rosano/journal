[DRIVER feat Juma Tutu (LASTA's Afro Disco Remix) | PYRAMID PROJECT feat Contours](https://pyramidprojectfeatcontours.bandcamp.com/track/driver-feat-juma-tutu-lastas-afro-disco-remix)

Single-bar bass loop probably never changes or stops; contrasted with sections featuring a kind of flute, chorus vocal hook (no idea what language it is), abstract saxophone solo and interjections; bass on each beat, booty-shaking, makes you dance and feel good.
